    <!-- The fonts are either included via a CDN from Google or from an existing CSS file
     and corresponding font files stored, e.g., under '/assets/fonts', and are included in 'index.html',
     not in the app components.

    !! IMPORTANT !!
    - To ensure the fonts are correctly exported only once to the dist/assets/fonts folder and not duplicated directly in dist,
    - To ensure the paths to the individual font files are correctly resolved in SCSS, CSS when using ng serve or ng build,
    - To ensure the fonts work in the Angular project and the individual components,
    - To ensure the SCSS/CSS properties for the fonts, defined in CSS/SCSS variables, work everywhere,
    - To ensure the same font settings are applied both for ng serve and ng build,

    the fonts should be set up as follows:

    1. The style font file (with @font-face { font-family: "XYZ-Font"; src: url("../fonts/xyz-font.eot"); ...} should be in .CSS format and NOT .SCSS format!
    2. This file should only be included once in the entire Angular project in index.html with <link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/styles/fonts.css" />.
    3. Configure "compilerOptions": { "baseUrl": "./", ... } in tsconfig.json.
    4. Configure "assets": ["src/favicon.ico", "src/assets"] in angular.json.
    5. Set the font family globally in the body once, unless components use different font families: body { font-family: 'XYZ-Fonts'; ... }.
      Components can override their own font family properties in their style files.
    6. Do not re-import assets/styles/fonts.css in angular.component.scss or in XYZ.component.scss with @import in SCSS or CSS. -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/styles/_typography.css" />
