  "Hello, I am Lukas. A Clean Code enthusiast, mechanical engineer with 8 years of experience in the energy and chemical industry, and a passionate soccer player as well as music producer and DJ. I earned my academic degree, Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering (M.Sc.) from Ruhr University in Bochum. As a frontend and backend developer, I have been working in the IT department of a chemical park in Germany for 2 years. Through an internal transfer from the engineering department, where I worked on brownfield and greenfield projects in the triple-digit million range, I have gained extensive experience in teamwork, project management, leadership, and IT as well as CAD database tasks.": "Hello, I am Lukas.

  "During my intensive training as a frontend and backend developer, I deepened my knowledge in these technologies and specialized in the development of web apps and APIs. In the process, I gained a lot of experience and always received positive feedback from experienced mentors. I was able to quickly learn various technologies and was always looking for new challenges to further develop myself. I am a very structured and analytical thinker and can solve complex tasks quickly and effectively. I have demonstrated this during training in various projects both in teams and independently, and I have also gained important experience in collaboration and project management. Therefore, I am used to taking responsibility and working carefully.": "During my intensive training as a frontend and backend developer, I deepened my knowledge in these technologies and specialized in the development of web apps and APIs.
